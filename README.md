# Data Structures and Algorithms – Lab Assignments (C)

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) lab programs**
implemented in **C language**.  
The programs cover fundamental and advanced data structures along with their
operations and applications.

The repository is organized **topic-wise** for easy understanding and reference.
Each folder contains:
- C source code files (`.c`)
- Corresponding lab assignment PDFs (`.pdf`)
